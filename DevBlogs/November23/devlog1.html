        <h3>Blogging in HTML</h3>
        <p>Well, I have written over 40 articles on medium, ton of self essays in Notion and Obsidian, which were mostly in the <b>markdown format</b>
        Writing something in html feels uniquely weird as if you OK,Howare adding comments to your code. It all feels the same way Mark Zukerberg wrote his blogs in <b>The Social Network</b>,
         I remember him using tags and the < / p > thing.
        </p>
        <h3>Building this Mess</h3>
        <p>I am writing while building the website, in fact <b>at the time this is being written, the website only has a very basic home page a "Blogs Section"</b></p>
        <p>The Archive and About do not even work yet!</p>

        <h3>AutoUpdate</h3>
        <p>It soon became clear that I need a way to automatically update this website's content. Say I add a new blog, I will have to edit the main page, the blogs page, everything, which is a lot of work. </p>
        <p>I have read JS can do all the stuff, but till I learn that we are stuck with this...yay. I believe I will have to wirte a code in <b>Python</b> to convert Markdown Documents to html documents, as <b>writing in markdown is just easier</b>...</p> Inventing solutions that probably already exist, cuz I want to!
